SYSTEM FEATURES

Feature 1: Student Dashboard and Predictive Allocation
Priority: High

The system shows real-time admission probabilities using three factors:

Historical data

Implicit student intent

Live choice data

It uses color indicators and percentage values.
A strict 3-day countdown timer is enforced by the server.

Functional Requirements:
FR-01 Authenticate student and show admission rank
FR-02 Show department status with color and probability
FR-03 Enforce countdown timer
FR-04 Lock submitted choices with timestamps
FR-05 Enforce 30-minute cooldown for edits
FR-06 Provide bilingual support
FR-07 Maintain availability during updates
FR-08 Filter departments by campus and college

Feature 2: Registrar Office Data Management
Priority: High

Administrators can upload data, configure algorithms, and manage rounds.

Functional Requirements:
FR-09 Secure admin login
FR-10 Upload placement data files
FR-11 Configure prediction parameters
FR-12 Set round start and end times
FR-13 Seal allocation rounds
FR-14 View system metrics
FR-15 Maintain audit logs

SYSTEM LOGIC AND BUSINESS RULES

BR-01 Placement is merit-based but requires submission before deadline
BR-02 Sealed rounds cannot be changed
BR-03 Unassigned students move to next round

Algorithms:
Dynamic Capacity Algorithm calculates actual seats.
Tri-Factor Algorithm calculates cut-off and probability.

Status Rules:
Green: Eligible and seats available
